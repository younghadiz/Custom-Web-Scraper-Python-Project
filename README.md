# Custom-Web-Scraper-Python-Project
Python code for a custom web scraper to collect data on things that are interested in.

# How it works

You need to replace `TARGET_URL` with the URL of the website you would like to scrape and inspect the websiteâ€™s HTML structure to determine the classes or tags of the elements you want to scrape. Then, update the selectors in the `scrape_data` function (e.g., `soup.find_all("div", class_="item-class"`)).
